        post_text: '<div><span class="main-letter">P</span><strong>aris</strong> is the capital and most populous city of <strong>France</strong>, with an administrative limits area of 105 square kilometres (41 square miles) and a 2015 population of 2,229,621. The city is a commune and department, and the capital-heart of the 12,012-square-kilometre (4,638-square-mile) Île-de-France region (colloquially known as the ‘Paris Region’), whose 12,142,802 2016 population represents roughly 18 percent of the population of France. By the 17th century, Paris had become one of Europe’s major centers of finance, commerce, fashion, science, and the arts, a position that it retains still today. The <strong>Paris Region</strong> had a GDP of €649.6 billion (The US $763.4 billion) in 2014, accounting for 30.4 percent of the GDP of France. According to official estimates, in 2013-14 the Paris Region had the third-highest GDP in the world and the largest regional GDP in the EU.<p>The City of Paris’ administrative limits form a horizontal oval centered on its historical-heart Île de la Cité island; this island is near the peak of an arc of Seine river that divides the city into southern Rive Gauche (Left Bank) and northern Rive Droite regions.</p><p><strong>Paris</strong> is but the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the agglomération Parisienne, and statistically, as a unité urbaine (a measure of urban area), the Paris agglomeration’s 10,601,122 2013 population makes it the largest urban area in the European Union.[3] City-influenced commuter activity reaches well beyond even this in a statistical aire urbaine de Paris (a measure of metropolitan area), that had a 2013 population of 12,405,426, a number one-fifth the population of France,  and one that makes it, after London, the second largest metropolitan area in the European Union. The 2016 Metropole of Grand Paris initiative, encompassing the City of Paris and its surrounding petite couronne department communes, or an area covering 814 square kilometers and representing a population of 7 million, aims to improve city-suburb cooperation through a unique governing body.</p><p><img class="alignleft" src="/images/postsimg/postsitemimg/lisbeth-demo1-2.2.jpg" alt=""></p><p>The city is a major rail, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Paris-Charles de Gaulle (the second busiest airport in Europe after London Heathrow Airport with 63.8 million passengers in 2014) and Paris-Orly. Opened in 1900, the city’s subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily, and is the second busiest metro system in Europe after Moscow Metro. Paris’ Gare du Nord is one of the ten busiest railway stations in the world, with 262 million passengers in 2015.</p><p>Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre was the most visited art museum in the world in 2016, with 7.4 million visitors. The Musée d’Orsay and Musée de l’Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art, and the Pompidou-center Musée National d’Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe. The historical district along Seine River in the city center is classified as a UNESCO Heritage Site. Popular landmarks in the center of the city include the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris and The Gothic royal chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, both on the Île de la Cité; the Eiffel Tower, constructed for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889; the Grand Palais and Petit Palais, built for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900; the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs Elysees, and the Basilica of Sacré-Coeur on the hill of Montmartre. Paris received 22.2 million visitors in 2015, making it one of the world’s top tourist destinations, but the number of greater Paris visitors dropped by 11.5 percent following the terrorist attacks the following year.</p><div class="post-quote"><span class="quote-text">Paris is located in northern central France. By road, it is 450 kilometres (280 mi) southeast of London, 287 kilometres (178 mi) south of Calais, 305 kilometres (190 mi) southwest of Brussels, 774 kilometres (481 mi) north of Marseille, 385 kilometres (239 mi) northeast of Nantes, and 135 kilometres (84 mi) southeast of Rouen</span></div><p>Most French rulers since the Middle Ages made a point of leaving their mark on a city that, contrary to many other of the world’s capitals, has never been destroyed by catastrophe or war. In modernizing its infrastructure through the centuries, Paris has preserved even its earliest history in its street map.  At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed around several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine; of those, two remain today: the île Saint-Louis, the île de la Cité; a third one is 1827 artificially created île aux Cygnes.</p><p class="post-source"><strong>Source: <a href="">Wikihow</a></strong></p></div>',

If you want something more festive rather than Christmas-y, you could make some natural or rustic decorations instead. Tucked into a vase, pine branches can help lend a festive air to just about any home.<div class="post-quote"><span class="quote-text">Christmas colors, such as red, white, and green are the most popular, but you can use other colors too, like silver, gold, and blue.</span></div><p><strong>1. Craft a Christmas tree ornament with buttons and embroidery floss.</strong> Cut a long piece of embroidery thread, then slip a needle onto each end. Push each needle through a hole on a stack of small brown buttons. Next, push the needles through a stack of green buttons, starting with the largest and finishing with the smallest. Pull the needles off, then tie the embroidery thread to make a hanging loop.</p><ul><li>Plan on using 4 to 5 brown buttons, and around 10 to 12 green buttons.</li><li>The green buttons dont have to be the same shade. You can use a mixture of light, medium, and dark green buttons.</li><li>Make the knot about 3 inches (7.6 cm) above the last green button. Cut off the excess embroidery floss.</li></ul><p><strong>2. Build a snowman with Styrofoam balls, toothpicks, and pipe cleaners.</strong> Connect 2 Styrofoam balls (1 large and 1 small) using a drop of hot glue or a toothpick. Coil a pipe cleaner into a cone shape, then hot glue it on top of the smaller ball to make a hat. Slide a piece of thread between the coils on the hat, then tie the ends together to make a hanging loop.</p><ul><li>Use a black marker to draw some eyes and a mouth on the smaller ball, and buttons on the larger ball.</li><li>Cut the tip off of a toothpick, color it with orange markers or acrylic paint, then press it into the middle of the snowmans face to make a nose.</li><li>Wrap a narrow ribbon around the snowmans neck to make a scarf or bow.</li><li>Choose Styrofoam balls that have about 1 inch (2.5 cm) difference between them. For example, you can use a 2 in (5.1 cm) ball and a 1 in (2.5 cm) ball.</li></ul><p><img class="alignleft" src="/images/postsimg/postsitemimg/lisbeth-demo1-7.1.1.jpg" alt=""></p><p><strong>3. Make snowflakes on wax paper with hot glue, then peel them off.</strong> Use a hot glue gun to draw an asterisk shape on a sheet of wax paper. Press a piece of looped string into the top of the snowflake. Add some horizontal, vertical, and V-shaped lines to the asterisks arms to make it look more like a snowflake. Wait for the glue to set, then peel the snowflake off.</p><ul><li>You can use plain hot glue or glittery hot glue.</li><li>If you cant find glittery hot glue, sprinkle glitter onto the snowflakes before the glue sets.</li></ul><p><strong>4. Paint and decorate pinecones to look like Christmas trees.</strong> Find a pinecone and clean it with water. Let it dry, then paint it green with acrylic paint. Use hot glue to secure "ornaments," such as sequins, mini pompoms, and large beads. Tie a loop of thread to the top of the pinecone so that you can hang it.</p><ul><li>Wrap a gold chain or pipe cleaner around the pinecone to make garlands.</li><li>Draw small, colorful dots with puffy paint to make Christmas lights.</li></ul><p><strong>5. Make a reindeer with a candy cane and craft items.</strong> Hot glue a mini pompom to the short, hooked end of a candy cane. Add a pair of tiny googly eyes about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the nose. Center a brown pipe cleaner against the top, curved part of the candy cane, then wrap it a few times. Bend or curl both ends of the pipe cleaner to look like antlers.</p><ul><li>Use a red pompom to make Rudolf, and a brown or black pompom to make a normal reindeer.</li><li>Make sure that you are using a hook or J-shaped candy cane. Do not unwrap it, or you will end up with a sticky mess.</li><li>You can use a traditional red-and-white candy cane, or you can use a more colorful one.</li></ul><p>Your decorations dont need to have a classic red-and-green Christmas theme. They can have a white-and-blue winter theme.</p><p>If your glittered items keep shedding, wait until everything dries, then paint over the glitter with clear, glossy, sealer.</p><p class="post-source"><strong>Source:<a href="/">Wikihow</a></strong></p></div>',

        post_text: '<div><span class="main-letter">F</span>all is a versatile season for fashion. The weather starts getting cooler, making heavier-knit fabrics, boots, and chunky accessories in vogue. The occasional mix of warmer weather also makes lighter clothing appropriate, as well. To be fashionable in the fall, stick with an autumn color scheme and wear clothing that seems sensible for whatever the weather is outside.<p>The most notable thing about fall fashion is the color scheme. Sticking with colors and patterns associated with autumn will lead you down the path of becoming fall fashionable. <strong>Consider the seasons natural color scheme.</strong> Autumn is most notable for the way the trees change color and shed their leaves. Form your color palette of the natural color palette by opting for colors associated with this process. Think reds, oranges, yellows, browns, and deep burgundy-violets.</p><p><strong>Look for the year’s “in” colors.</strong> While fashionable autumn colors usually stay within the same general palette, each year comes with its own list of colors that are considered especially stylish. For instance, in 2011, burnt olive, coral, burgundy, teal, and coffee were among the most fashionable choices. Research the season’s “in” colors a few months before the start of autumn to get a good idea of what colors to look for.</p><p><img class="alignleft" src="/images/postsimg/postsitemimg/lisbeth-demo1-1.5.2.jpg" alt=""></p><p><strong>Go with deeper shades for a warmer look.</strong> Deeper shades, like chocolate brown or burgundy, create a warm, “cozy” feeling ideal for the cooling weather. To maximize this effect, opt for colors generally associated with the warm side of the color spectrum, like reds, over colors found on the cool end, like blues.</p><p><strong>Stick with lighter shades for a more feminine look.</strong> Darker, deeper colors work great for the fall, but they also create a heavier appearance. If you want a lighter, more feminine look, stick with brighter fall palette options like gold or coral.</p><p><strong>Think flannel.</strong> You do not need to stick with the traditional red and black “lumberjack” look. The flannel print is available in a wide variety of patterns, colors, and fabrics. This pattern is naturally associated with cooler weather, though, making fall the perfect time to start breaking out your flannel print pieces.</p><p>For tops, stick with what makes sense according to the weather. Heavy sweaters work best in late fall when the weather is cold, but cotton-blend blouses may look more appropriate during the early part of the season.</p><p><strong>Introduce heavier materials into your wardrobe.</strong> Think heavy-knit cotton, wools, cashmere, and traditional flannel fabric, among others. Stay away from sheer, flimsy materials, especially as the weather gets cooler. Heavy materials will keep you warmer, and they also look more appropriate than light materials.</p><p><strong>Wear more sweaters.</strong> Sweaters scream fall and winter. Lighter sweaters with standard or low necklines work especially well for fall when the weather is chilly yet not quite frigid.</p><p><strong>Layer your shirts.</strong> Wear tank tops and camisoles underneath low-cut blouses and vests over long-sleeve t-shirts. Layers keep you warmer and give your style more versatility.</p><p class="post-source"><strong>Source: <a href="">Wikihow</a></strong></p></div>',

        '<div><span class="main-letter">B</span>uying pieces of jewelry can be pretty expensive, even if it’s just costume jewelry. However, crafting handmade jewelry can mean much more than making nice pieces of jewelry pieces at lower cost; you can also make jewelry that closely matches your personal style and taste. By learning a few basic techniques, you should be able to construct unique styles of jewelry sets, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and more.<div class="post-quote"><span class="quote-text">Try making Swarovski crystal earrings. These earrings are fairly simple to make, and only require two crystals for your charms, two jump rings, and two earring findings. You will also need a set of pliers to help open and close the jewelry pieces.</span></div><p><strong>1. Buy a jewelry making kit.</strong> Jewelry making kits provide you with basic supplies and tools that allow you to customize different jewelry pieces and make them all your own. Most kits come with some basic instructions with different jewelry ideas, but you can use your imagination to create whatever kind of jewelry you want.</p><ul><li>There are many variations of jewelry making kits depending on what specific kind of jewelry you want to make.</li><li>For example, there are beading jewelry kits, stringing jewelry kits, and wire jewelry kits, just to name a few.</li></ul><p>Common skills and techniques that must be learned include opening jump rings, cutting wire, wire working, stringing, and using jigs and pegs, just to name a few.</p><p><strong>2. Pick out a specific jewelry project you want to try.</strong> Because there is such a variety in possible pieces of jewelry (necklaces, bracelets, earrings), made out of many possible materials (beads, wire, string, resin, paper, etc.), pick out a material and piece of jewelry you want to work on making. Find inspiration by visiting jewelry stores or looking online at social platforms, visual organizational websites, or jewelry retailer websites.</p><p><img class="alignleft" src="/images/postsimg/postsitemimg/lisbeth-demo1.jpg"></p><p><strong>3. Purchase jewelry making tools.</strong> Depending on what kind of jewelry you plan to make, you’ll probably need some basic tools to complete your project. Some basic tools all beginners should consider having include:</p><ul><li>A variety of pliers – round nose pliers, chain nose pliers, step jaw pliers, bent closing pliers, and nylon jaw pliers.</li><li>A metal ruler that measures both centimeters and inches.</li><li>Wire cutters.</li><li>Practice wire, to practice bending and shaping your wire before you attempt to bend your more expensive wire for your actual project.</li><li>Pegboards for bending wire.</li></ul><p><strong>4. Purchase handmade jewelry supplies.</strong> Handmade jewelry can be crafted with many different kinds of supplies, but there are a few basic supplies that are used on most handmade jewelry pieces. Jewelry kits can provide you with general or project specific supplies, but if you plan to start making jewelry without using a kit, you need to purchase some supplies on your own. Consider buying some:</p><ul><li>Beads.</li><li>Jewelry wire in common gauge sizes (18, 20, and 22); 20 gauge is best for beginners.</li><li>Headpins for earrings.</li><li>Clasps and closures.</li><li>Jump rings.</li></ul><p><strong>5. Become familiar with basic jewelry measurements.</strong> In order to determine how big or small you want your jewelry piece to be, familiarize yourself with some basic jewelry measurements. There are common, standard sizes for necklaces, and bracelets (depending on if the jewelry is for men or women), and how long you want the piece to hang.	</p><ul><li>For example, different necklace styles are certain lengths. Chokers are about 14 – 16 inches in length, princes’ style necklaces are about 17 – 19 inches in length and rope necklaces are about 34 inches in length and longer.</li><li>Necklaces that fall just below the collar bone tend to measure about 17 inches for women and about 20 inches for men. Common bracelet lengths measure about 7 inches for women, and between 8 – 11 inches for men.</li></ul><p><strong>6. Learn some basic jewelry making skills and techniques.</strong> In order to begin the process of making your own jewelry piece, you must learn some basic skills and techniques in order to successfully complete your project. Common skills and techniques that must be learned include opening jump rings, cutting wire, wire working, stringing, and using jigs and pegs, just to name a few.	</p><ul><li>To learn these different techniques you can read jewelry making books, search for tutorials, and take jewelry-making workshops.</li><li>Search online for instructions on how to make the specific earrings, bracelet, ring, or other kinds of jewelry you want to try making.</li></ul><p><strong>7. Assemble your required materials.</strong> Once you have a chosen jewelry project that you want to make, gather and assemble all of the needed materials. Again, your materials can come from a jewelry making kit, or you can research a style of jewelry, determine the level of difficulty, and then buy the necessary materials yourself. 	</p><ul><li>For example, in order to start making charm earrings, you first have to select the charms you want to use. Charms can be found online, at craft stores, or jewelry stores. Then you have to select your earring findings, which are the parts of the earring that fit through your ear piercing.</li><li>When you are ready to begin making your jewelry, go over the instructions that you have acquired on how to make the jewelry piece.</li></ul><p><strong>8. Practice the technique before you make the real thing.</strong> As mentioned earlier, for wire jewelry, having practice wire is a good idea to practice and conquer a jewelry-making technique before you move on to bending and cutting your more expensive wire. That way, you get the hang of the technique with lots of repetition, so your final product is of high quality. 	</p><ul><li>No matter what kind of jewelry material you are using, always try to practice the technique first, before using your actual, precious jewelry materials.</li><li>Thin, copper wire is always a good choice for practice wire.</li></ul><p class="post-source"><strong>Source: <a href="">Wikihow</a></strong>	</p></div>',
